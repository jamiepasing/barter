# Barter - POS and Inventory Management

## Overview
Barter is a web and Cordova-based POS and inventory management application inspired by the historical concept of barter. It modernizes sari-sari store operations by providing FIFO-based inventory handling, expiration tracking, POS transactions, and profit monitoring through a simple and accessible interface. 

## Project Context
Barter is a project developed as a practical application of concepts learned during the developer's third and fourth year of college and first and second year of specializing in software development. This project was designed and implemented from scratch, with all core functionality, database schema, and interface design implemented by the developer using standard tools and frameworks only as a development platform, with the goal of integrating database design, web and mobile application development, system architecture, and user-centered interface design into a cohesive, real-world system<br>
<br>
This approach provided a personal challenge for the developer to apply and test their comprehension of the concepts learned in coursework, while building a fully functional application without relying on pre-built solutions

## Objectives
- Apply databasenormalization and transactional itegrity concepts <br>
- Implement FIFO inventory logic for accurate storck management <br>
- Design an accessible POS interface for sari-sari stores <br>
- Track product expiration and financial reporting <br>>
- Deploy a cross-platform application using Cordova <br>

## Features
- Product and category management (default and custom categories)<br>
- Stock entry with purchase price, markup, and expiration dates<br>
- FIFO-based stock deduction during sales<br>
- Transaction voiding and correction mechanism<br>
- POS checkout with automatic stock updates<br>
- Expiration monitoring and near-expiry alerts<br>
- Financial traking: total cost, expected earning, daily/weekly/monthly/annual income<br>
- Dashboard summaries with low-stock alerts and visual indicators <br>
- Cross-platrform support via Cordova (web + android)<br>
